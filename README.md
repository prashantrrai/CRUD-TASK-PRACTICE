Full-Stack CRUD Website using MEAN Stack
This is a sample README for a full-stack CRUD website built using the MEAN stack, which stands for MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js. The website implements various functionalities, including search, pagination, sorting, and more. Below, you will find an overview of the project, its functionalities, and instructions on how to set it up and run.

Project Overview
This MEAN stack CRUD website allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a collection of items. The project includes the following functionalities:

Create new items: Users can add new items to the collection.
View items: Users can view a list of all the items in the collection with search, pagination, and sorting options.
Update items: Users can edit the details of existing items in the collection.
Delete items: Users can remove items from the collection.
Technologies Used
MongoDB: A NoSQL database used for storing the collection of items.
Express.js: A backend framework for building RESTful APIs and handling server-side logic.
Angular: A frontend framework for building the user interface and interacting with the server through APIs.
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment used on the server side to run the Express.js application.
Setup Instructions
Follow the steps below to set up and run the MEAN stack CRUD website locally on your machine:

Prerequisites
Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) from the official website: https://nodejs.org/
Install MongoDB on your machine: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
Backend (Node.js & Express)
Clone or download the backend repository from GitHub.

Navigate to the backend directory in your terminal.

Install the dependencies using the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Create a .env file in the backend directory to store environment variables like database connection URL, port, etc. Set the MongoDB connection URL as follows:

makefile
Copy code
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_url
PORT=3000  # or any other port you prefer
Start the backend server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The Express.js server should now be running and connected to the MongoDB database.

Frontend (Angular)
Clone or download the frontend repository from GitHub.

Navigate to the frontend directory in your terminal.

Install the dependencies using the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Update the API URL in the environment.ts file located in src/environments/environment.ts to match the backend server's URL:

typescript
Copy code
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  apiUrl: 'http://localhost:3000/api', // Update the URL accordingly
};
Start the frontend development server:

bash
Copy code
ng serve
The Angular application should now be running and accessible at http://localhost:4200.

Usage
Once the backend and frontend servers are running, open your web browser and go to http://localhost:4200 to access the CRUD website. You can use the website to perform the following actions:

Create new items by clicking on the "Add New" button.
View a list of all items with search, pagination, and sorting options.
Update existing items by clicking on the "Edit" button next to each item.
Delete items by clicking on the "Delete" button next to each item.
